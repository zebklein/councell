                <p>&emsp;&emsp;I was born in California in 1949, daughter of an Army Chaplain and an accomplished musician, and the second of four children. In the way of most military families, we moved frequently, within the U.S. as well as in Europe and the Far East.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;After graduating from Kubasaki American High School in Okinawa in 1967, I studied art at the University of Redlands and the University of California Santa Barbara. Later I studied graphic design and illustration at UC Riverside.  I worked for four years as an illustrator in the Publications Office of UC Riverside before moving to the East Coast. Between 1988 to 1997 I illustrated six books for children, some of which earned national honors.  Memberships have included the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, the American Society of Botanical Illustrators, and, as co-chair, the New Jersey Chapter of ECVA (Episcopal Church and Visual Arts)
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I taught for 13 years at the Arts Council of Princeton, where I was honored as Teacher of the Year in 2007. I also taught art and offered workshops at Trinity Academy, Trenton, the Trent House Museum, The Cambridge School, and the Watershed Nature Center in Pennington, NJ, Morven Museum and Garden in Princeton, Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, NJ, and the Princeton Day School.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;My work has been exhibited at Michelson’s Gallery in Northampton, Mass, Seabury Western School of Theology in Evanston, Illinois, the Straube Center in Pennington, NJ, Trinity Cathedral, Trenton, and the Arts Council of Princeton.  My liturgical hangings can be found in Cranbury, Little Silver, and Trenton, New Jersey, and in Naples, Florida.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Now living in Kalamazoo, Michigan, I enjoys making art both alone and with friends in my home studio.
